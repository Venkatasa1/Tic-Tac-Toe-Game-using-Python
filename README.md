## Overview
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other by taking turns to place their respective marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- User-friendly command-line interface
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves
- Display of the game board after each move
- Announcement of the winner or if the game ends in a draw

## How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to enter the position (1-9) where they want to place their mark (X or O).
3. The positions correspond to the following grid layout:

   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6

   7 | 8 | 9
   ```
4. The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row, or all positions are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
